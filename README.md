# Ice-Hocky-Team-Manager
An app to manage your hockey team!

Project Description:
The project is an application which is used to store data of the matches the team has participate. 
User can enter the date, opponent team’s name and the result of that match. Thus, user can enter 
the point each team member has scored during the game. The list of players (which is stored in a 
combo box in the GUI) is read from the file “players.txt”. User can delete, add new player by editing
the text file as he/she want. All the matches user has created can be seen by choosing the match 
date in the combo box in GUI. And the statistics of players, which is basically the number of point 
they have scored through out all the matches, can also be seen by simply clicking the button to 
show.
